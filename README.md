# RankCheckerWithPython
RankChecker is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to retrieve and analyze search rankings for specific keywords across multiple competitor websites. Utilizing libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and openpyxl, this script automates the process of fetching ranking data and exporting it to an Excel file.

# Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.
Create a Project Directory
Create a new folder for your project, e.g., RankChecker.
Navigate to this folder using your command line or terminal.
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
Navigate to your project directory:
bash
cd path\to\RankChecker

Create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
bash
source venv/bin/activate

#**Step 2: Create the requirements.txt File**

Create a file named requirements.txt in your project directory.
Add the following lines to requirements.txt:
text
requests
beautifulsoup4
openpyxl

#**Step 3: Install Required Libraries**

Install the libraries listed in requirements.txt using pip:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


#**Step 4: Create the rank.py Script**

Create a file named rank.py in your project directory.
Copy and paste the following code into rank.py


#**Step 5: Customize HTML Parsing Logic**

Inspect the Target Website: Open the target website in your browser (e.g., Adidas).
Use Developer Tools: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" to open Developer Tools.
Find the Ranking Element: Locate the HTML element that contains the ranking information you want to scrape.
Update the Selector: Replace 'desired-class' in the code with the actual class or ID of that element.

#**Step 6: Run Your Script**

Open Your Terminal.
Navigate to Your Project Directory if you are not already there.
Run the Script with Python:
bash
python rank.py

#**Step 7: Check for Errors and Output**

If everything works correctly, an Excel file named running_shoes.xlsx will be created in your project directory containing the scraped data.
If you encounter errors such as 403 Forbidden, consider using proxies or adjusting your User-Agent string.

#**Common Issues and Cautions**

1.403 Forbidden Error:
This error indicates that access to the page is denied. You may need to adjust your User-Agent or use a proxy.

2.Proxy Configuration:
If you decide to use proxies, make sure they are valid and working.
Uncomment and set proxy settings correctly in the script.

3.HTML Structure Changes:
Websites often change their HTML structure, which can break your scraping logic. Regularly check and update your selectors accordingly.

4.Respect Robots.txt:
Always review a website's robots.txt file to ensure that scraping is allowed on specific pages.

5.Rate Limiting:
Be cautious about how frequently you send requests to avoid getting blocked by the server.

6.Legal Considerations:
Ensure compliance with legal guidelines regarding web scraping for each website you target.

Now you're ready to use RankChecker! Happy scraping!

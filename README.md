# RankCheckerWithPython

**RankChecker** is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to retrieve and analyze search rankings for specific keywords across multiple competitor websites. Utilizing libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `openpyxl`, this script automates the process of fetching ranking data and exporting it to an Excel file.


## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

### Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

### Create a Project Directory
1. Create a new folder for your project, e.g., `RankChecker`.
2. Navigate to this folder using your command line or terminal.

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\RankChecker
## Create a Virtual Environment

To create and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:

### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
## Step 2: Create the requirements.txt File

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory. Add the following lines to `requirements.txt`:

```text
requests
beautifulsoup4
openpyxl

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

Install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 4: Create the rank.py Script

Create a file named `rank.py` in your project directory. Copy and paste the following code into `rank.py`:

```python
# Sample code goes here


## Step 5: Customize HTML Parsing Logic

### Inspect the Target Website:
Open the target website in your browser (e.g., Adidas).

### Use Developer Tools:
Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" to open Developer Tools.

### Find the Ranking Element:
Locate the HTML element that contains the ranking information you want to scrape.

### Update the Selector:
Replace `desired-class` in the code with the actual class or ID of that element.


## Step 6: Run Your Script

Open your terminal. Navigate to your project directory if you are not already there. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python rank.py


## Step 7: Check for Errors and Output

If everything works correctly, an Excel file named `running_shoes.xlsx` will be created in your project directory containing the scraped data. If you encounter errors such as 403 Forbidden, consider using proxies or adjusting your User-Agent string.


## Common Issues and Cautions

### 403 Forbidden Error:
This error indicates that access to the page is denied. You may need to adjust your User-Agent or use a proxy.

### Proxy Configuration:
If you decide to use proxies, make sure they are valid and working. Uncomment and set proxy settings correctly in the script.

### HTML Structure Changes:
Websites often change their HTML structure, which can break your scraping logic. Regularly check and update your selectors accordingly.

### Respect Robots.txt:
Always review a website's `robots.txt` file to ensure that scraping is allowed on specific pages.

### Rate Limiting:
Be cautious about how frequently you send requests to avoid getting blocked by the server.

### Legal Considerations:
Ensure compliance with legal guidelines regarding web scraping for each website you target.

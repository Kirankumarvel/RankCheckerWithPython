# RankCheckerWithPython

**RankChecker** is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to retrieve and analyze search rankings for specific keywords across multiple competitor websites. Utilizing libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `openpyxl`, this script automates the process of fetching ranking data and exporting it to an Excel file.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

### Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

### Create a Project Directory
1. Create a new folder for your project, e.g., `RankChecker`.
2. Navigate to this folder using your command line or terminal.

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\RankChecker
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

## Step 2: Create the requirements.txt File

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory. Add the following lines to `requirements.txt`:

```text
requests==2.26.0
beautifulsoup4==4.10.0
pandas==1.3.3
halo==0.0.31
termcolor==1.1.0


## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

Install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 4: Create the rank.py Script

Create a file named `rank.py` in your project directory. Copy and paste the following code into `rank.py`:

```python
# Sample code goes here


## Step 5: Customize HTML Parsing Logic

### Inspect the Target Website:
Open the target website in your browser (e.g., Adidas).

### Use Developer Tools:
Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" to open Developer Tools.

### Find the Ranking Element:
Locate the HTML element that contains the ranking information you want to scrape.

### Update the Selector:
Replace `desired-class` in the code with the actual class or ID of that element.


## Step 6: Run Your Script

Open your terminal. Navigate to your project directory if you are not already there. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python rank.py


## Step 7: Check for Errors and Output

If everything works correctly, an Excel file named `running_shoes.xlsx` will be created in your project directory containing the scraped data. If you encounter errors such as 403 Forbidden, consider using a proxy.

## Common Issues and Cautions

### 403 Forbidden Error:
This error indicates that access to the page is denied. You may need to adjust your User-Agent or use a proxy.

### Proxy Configuration:
If you decide to use proxies, make sure they are valid and working. Uncomment and set proxy settings correctly in the script.

### HTML Structure Changes:
Websites often change their HTML structure, which can break your scraping logic. Regularly check and update your selectors accordingly.

### Respect Robots.txt:
Always review a website's `robots.txt` file to ensure that scraping is allowed on specific pages.

### Rate Limiting:
Be cautious about how frequently you send requests to avoid getting blocked by the server.

### Legal Considerations:
Ensure compliance with legal guidelines regarding web scraping for each website you target.

## Avoiding Errors While Executing Python Scripts

To avoid errors while executing Python scripts and managing dependencies, itâ€™s essential to follow best practices and keep in mind several key points. Below is a comprehensive list that includes the installation commands for specific libraries along with tips to ensure smooth execution.

### Key Libraries and Installation Commands

| Module Name | Installation Command          | Description                                                |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| bs4         | pip install beautifulsoup4    | Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.                |
| halo        | pip install halo              | A library for creating beautiful command line spinners.    |
| openpyxl    | pip install openpyxl          | A library for reading and writing Excel files.             |
| requests    | pip install requests          | Library for making HTTP requests.                          |
| pandas      | pip install pandas            | Data analysis and manipulation library.                    |
| numpy       | pip install numpy             | Fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.  |
| matplotlib  | pip install matplotlib        | Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. |
| flask       | pip install flask             | A lightweight WSGI web application framework.              |
| pytest      | pip install pytest            | A framework for testing Python code.                       |
| scikit-learn| pip install scikit-learn      | Machine learning library for Python.                       |

### Best Practices to Avoid Errors

- **Use Virtual Environments:**
  Always create a virtual environment for your projects to manage dependencies separately and avoid conflicts.
  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  myenv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
  # or
  source myenv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
  ```

- **Upgrade pip and setuptools:**
  Ensure you have the latest version of pip and setuptools to avoid compatibility issues.
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
  ```

- **Check Python Version Compatibility:**
  Some libraries may have specific version requirements or may not be compatible with certain versions of Python. Always check the documentation for compatibility.

- **Install Dependencies from a Requirements File:**
  Use a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies efficiently.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Handle Missing Modules:**
  If you encounter a "ModuleNotFoundError," ensure that the module is installed using pip.

- **Read Error Messages Carefully:**
  Pay attention to error messages during installation; they often provide clues about what went wrong (e.g., missing dependencies).

- **Check for Build Tools:**
  Some packages require additional build tools (like Cython or compilers) to be installed on your system, especially when compiling from source.

- **Use Absolute Paths When Necessary:**
  If your script relies on files (like JSON or CSV), use absolute paths to avoid issues related to relative paths.

- **Test Your Environment:**
  After setting up your environment, test it by running simple scripts that import the libraries you plan to use.

- **Keep Libraries Updated:**
  Regularly update your libraries to benefit from bug fixes and new features.
  ```bash
  pip list --outdated  # List outdated packages
  pip install --upgrade <package_name>  # Upgrade specific package
  ```
